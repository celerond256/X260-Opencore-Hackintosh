**Note:**
* After replace wifi card to Broadcom and get Airdrop + Handoff working, I rarely boot to windows 10. So I decided to reinstall and format SSD fully for Catalina.
* I installed virtualbox and Windows 7 just to get one or two windows app for daily work. And found it was more comfortable this way.
